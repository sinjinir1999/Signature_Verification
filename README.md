# WRITER INDEPENDENT SIGNATURE VERIFICATION
## WRITER INDEPENDENT SIGNATURE VERIFICATION | METHODOLOGY
The aim of the project is to review the presented Signature Verification/Recognition methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks and evaluate the performance of some the prominent available Deep Convolutional Neural Networks in Writer Independent Signature Verification/Recognition.This is done using four Pre-trained Models: 
1. MobileNetV2
